Handling Missing Values:
Data cleaning is an essential step in preparing a dataset for machine learning models. It involves handling missing values, outliers, and multicollinearity, which can affect the accuracy and reliability of the model's predictions.

Missing Values: Missing values are data points that are not recorded or available in the dataset. They can occur for various reasons, such as data entry errors or incomplete data collection. Handling missing values is crucial to ensure that the model is trained on complete and reliable data. There are several common approaches to handle missing values:

Deletion: If the number of missing values is relatively small compared to the dataset size, you can choose to remove the rows or columns containing missing values. However, this approach should be used cautiously to avoid losing valuable information.

Imputation: Imputation involves filling in missing values with estimated or calculated values. Simple imputation methods include filling missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the respective feature. More advanced techniques, such as regression imputation or k-nearest neighbors imputation, can also be used based on the nature of the data and the specific problem.
